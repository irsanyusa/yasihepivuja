About 60 people were inside the bar at the time of the shooting, police said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Witnesses inside described a chaotic scene, including people throwing bar stools through windows to clear an escape path. One woman said her friend threw her over a wall to get her out of harm’s way. Others hid under pool tables and in bathrooms. The entire shooting took about two and a half minutes, police said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Sgt. Ron Helus</a> of the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office was fatally wounded during a confrontation with the gunman. He and a California Highway Patrol officer responded to the shooting within two minutes, Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said early Thursday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The California Highway Patrol Officer “secured the perimeter” and then rescued Helus “out of the line of the gunfire,” Dean said. Helus later died at a local hospital.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When other officers made entry into the bar about 15 minutes later, they found a bloody scene with 11 victims dead, Dean said. The gunman was also dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dean said this morning that the bar looked “like hell” after the shooting.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In addition to the dead, one person received a minor gunshot wound and eight to 15 people were hurt escaping the bar in the chaos.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Sgt. Ron Helus ‘died a hero’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ventura-police-sheriff-shooting.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Helus was a 29-year veteran of the sheriff’s office who was hoping to retire next year. Dean said Helus, 54, was his friend and the two often worked out together.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Ron was a hard-working, dedicated sheriff’s sergeant. He was totally committed. He gave his all, and as I told his wife tonight, he died a hero because he went in to save lives, to save other people,” Dean told reporters, his voice cracking as he spoke.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Police said that off-duty law enforcement officers happened to be at the time of the shooting. The officers were unarmed, but tried to help the bar patrons during the assault.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>VC Sheriff’s Sgt. Ron Helus was a firearms instructor for more than 25 years. “During my time on the SWAT team, I was an instructor for the basic and advanced SWAT schools ...

News-Press (@sbnpnews) <a href=#>November 8, 2018</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Helus is survived by a wife and a son.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">First victims named</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Alaina Hously, an 18-year-old student at Pepperdine University, was killed during the shooting. Her aunt and uncle, the actress Tamera Mowry and former Fox News reporter Adam Housley, confirmed her death in a joint statement.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Our hearts are broken. We just learned that our niece Alaina was one of the victims of last night’s shooting at Borderline bar in Thousand Oaks,” the statement read. “Alaina was an incredible young woman with so much life ahead of her and we are devastated that her life was cut short in this manner. We thank everyone for your prayers and ask for privacy at this time.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Adam Housley had shared his worry about his niece on Twitter in the hours since the shooting, saying that she is a “beautiful soul” and asking for prayers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Alaina Hously’s suitemate, who lists her name as Ashley, also took to Twitter to say that her friend was missing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Pls pray for my residence hall, a handful of girls went to line dance tonight and they’re not all accounted for,” Ashley wrote.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">California Lutheran University confirmed that one of its alums, 23-year-old Justin Meek, had been killed during the shooting. The university said that Meek had saved people during the shooting.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Cal Lutheran wraps its arms around the Meek family and other families, and around every member of this community of caring,” the university said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jason Coffman told reporters that he had learned from police that his son, 22-year-old Camarillo resident Cody Coffman, was killed in the bar.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cody Coffman loved sports and fishing, and was preparing to join the Army, Jason Coffman said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I just want him to know he’s going to be missed,” Jason Coffman said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He added that Cody Coffman will be particularly missed by the young man’s three younger brothers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I talked to him last night before he headed out the door,” Jason Coffman said. “First thing I said was son, don’t drink and drive. Last thing I said was son I love you.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jason Coffman said that his son’s friends had knocked on the family’s door at around 1 a.m. to say that they had been at the bar with Cody, but that they had not seen him leave.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cody Coffman was the first victim inside the bar to be named. Authorities announced Helus’ death early Thursday.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Chaos inside Borderline Bar & Grill</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Witnesses reported a chaotic scene inside the bar after the gunman began shooting.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“All of a sudden you hear the bang bang of the gun shot and it just started going crazy,” one woman who was inside the bar <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a>. “We didn’t take it seriously at first because it just sounded like firecrackers.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Everyone just dropped down onto the floor. We couldn’t get out because the shooting was on that side,” she continued. “So our friends got the bar stools and started slamming them against the window so we could get out.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A man who was near the front door when the shooting began <a href=# rel=noopener>told ABC 7</a>, “I was talking to my stepdad and I just started hearing these big pops. I look up and the security guard was shot.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The gunman was throwing smoke grenades all over the place. I saw him point to the back of the cash register. And he just kept firing.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another witness told ABC 7, “I should have stayed until he changed his clip, but I was worried about my boy. I probably should have stayed. I apologize to anybody who got hurt. I’m sorry. They’re so young. I’m 56. This shouldn’t have happened to them.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Gunman was Marine veteran described as ‘quiet’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ian-david-long-thousand-oaks-shooting-california.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Police said today that Ian David Long, 28, is a Marine Corps veteran. Long lived with his mother in Newbury Park, Calif., police said. Police said that they believe that Long may have been affected by post-traumatic stress disorder, but that they have not yet determined his motive.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">An FBI official said investigators are working to determine Long’s motivation, looking into his state of mind leading up to the shooting, whether there was any potential radicalization and whether Long had any associates. FBI officials added that they are currently examining Long’s vehicle and Newbury Park, Calif. residence.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After walking inside the Borderline Bar and Grill, Long threw a smoke bomb and carried out the bar shooting with a legal Glock 21 .45-caliber handgun, police said. The gun is designed to hold ten rounds and one in the chamber, but Long’s gun had been illegally modified with an extended magazine.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Witnesses and authorities described the gunman as wearing dark clothing and staying silent while firing inside the bar. A witness <a href=# rel=noopener>told CNN</a> the shooter wore a black trench coat and eyeglasses and had a black beard.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Investigators with the FBI and Ventura County Sheriff’s Office have not identified the shooter or explained the shooter’s motive. Police have secured Long’s house for their investigation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Police said that Long had been involved several incidents where law enforcement were called.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In April, police had investigated a “disturbance” at Long’s home, and a mental health crisis team had assessed Long’s condition. The specialist determined at that time that Long did not appear to qualify for involuntary commitment under California law, police said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He was somewhat irate, acting a little irrationally,” Dean said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to the Associated Press, that specialist assessed Long but concluded he couldn’t be involuntarily committed for psychiatric observation and he was cleared that day.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dean also said the specialist was also concerned that Long might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder “basing that (on) the fact that he was a veteran and had been in the Corps,” per the AP.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Long was also a victim of a battery at a local bar in 2015, police said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Long served in the Marine Corps and was trained as a machine gunner from 2008 to 2011. He was deployed in Afghanistan from November 2010 to June 2011, according to the Marines.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Newbury Park resident Winnet Blake, who had been Long’s roommate, said he was shocked when he found out about the news.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He was just quiet and kept to himself, he was just a roommate,” Blake tells TIME. “I was shocked, I was like ‘what the hell this is crazy.’”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The two were roommates two separate times, once in Ventura County for eight months and then again for a year and a half in Los Angeles County. Blake said the last time they were roommates was two years ago.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Blake added that while the two lived together Long mostly kept to himself. Blake said Long served in the Marines but, to his knowledge, he did not keep guns around the apartment and he was not aware if he was politically active.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“That’s not something we spoke about.” Blake said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to the Associated Press, Long’s mother, Colleen, posted Facebook photos of her son wearing his military uniform in 2010 and 2011.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“My Son is home, well sort of, back in Hawaii, soon to be in Cali come January, hooray!” she wrote on Dec. 14, 2012.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another photo from 2014 shows Long with his arm draped around his mother in front of Dodger Stadium. The two were wearing Dodgers T-shirts and smiles, AP said.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Students crowded in bar for ‘college night’</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It was college country theme night at Borderline Bar & Grill, and multiple Pepperdine University and California Lutheran University were inside the bar at the time of the shooting.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The University has determined that multiple Pepperdine students were on site at Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks.
