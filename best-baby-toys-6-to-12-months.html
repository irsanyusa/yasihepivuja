With an overwhelming amount of options out there, it can be hard to narrow down what kids truly need at every age and stage, as well as what’s actually worth purchasing.</p><p>“During this age range (6-12 months), babies are developing their fine motor skills such as the ability to grasp, hold, and manipulate objects,” says Michelle Mintz, M.S., CCC-SLP, an early childhood development expert and creator of Baby Blooming Moments. “They’re also developing their gross motor skills such as learning to sit up, crawl, stand, and possibly start walking.”</p><p>Of course, they’re putting everything in their mouths, exploring different textures, sounds, and cause and effect, and beginning to babble, too. I spoke with multiple play experts to discover the best baby toys for 6-12 months to help support their development. Read on to shop their personal favorites, as well as my own as a seasoned mom of three young children aged six and under.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-baby-toys-for-6-12-months>Our top picks for the best baby toys for 6-12 months</h2><h3><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Edushape Sensory Mini Balls</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Edushape Sensory Mini Balls</h3></p><p>They’ll have a ball exploring, touching, and even teething on these popular sensory balls. Available in a set of six, “these balls of different shapes, textures, and colors allow for fun sensorimotor play and can facilitate fun bonding with caregivers, as babies are now much more curious of materials and seeking playful engagement,” says licensed clinical social worker and play expert <a rel=nofollow href=#>Jennifer Rothman</a>. “They can explore these balls in so many ways: Reaching, holding, rolling, mouthing, banging, dropping, hiding and finding, visually tracking where it goes, crawling for it, and so much more.”</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: Plastic</li><li>Batteries required: No</li><li>Age range: 0+ months</li><li>Price at time of publish: $19.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>BPA- and phthalate-free</li><li>Easy for little hands to grip</li><li>Available in a variety of colors</li><li>Develops gross and fine motor skills</li><li>Provides sensory stimulation</li><li>Many ways to play</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Pets can easily mistake them for their own toys</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>These colorful sensory balls are super fun for babies and also help boost sensory and motor development.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Edushape Sensory Mini Balls</a></p><h3><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Taf Toys Baby Activity Arch</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Taf Toys Baby Activity Arch</h3></p><p>If you’re looking for stroller toys for zero to six months that can easily take you through the first year, I highly recommend this versatile activity arch for on the go. There are black and white and colorful butterflies hanging to stimulate newborns’ visual senses. For babies three months and up, there’s a rattling beads maze, a bunny with crinkling ears and beads, and a double-sided spinning mirror to practice motor skills and develop hand-eye coordination. It easily attaches to car seats, strollers, and bouncers to entertain baby when you’re out and about or just have to get things done around the house. I like that it’s height adjustable, so you can reposition as baby grows.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: ‎Not listed</li><li>Batteries required: No</li><li>Age range: 0-12 months</li><li>Price at time of publish: $29.95</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Great for entertaining on the go or at home</li><li>Versatile so can attach to many things</li><li>Visually stimulating</li><li>Hanging toys for baby to play with</li><li>Built-in sensory elements</li><li>Plenty of developmental benefits</li><li>Height adjustable</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Some reviewers had trouble attaching it</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>This entertaining activity arch is super versatile, attaching to strollers, prams, bouncers, and more to keep them happy when you can’t.</p><h3><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Lovevery Play Kits</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Lovevery Play Kits</h3></p><p>Researching the best baby and toddler toys can be time consuming, but Lovevery does the hard work for you. “These kits are selected by child development experts who know how best to support hearty brain growth during the early, formative years,” says Bowen-Poole. Each kit is tailored to your baby’s age and stage of development and includes engaging, gorgeous, and high-quality modern toys (many wooden) that you won’t mind adorning your playroom. The best part?

Mintz highly recommends what she calls “sticky bubbles.” “They are fun, unique bubbles that don't pop and are great for sensory stimulation and increasing attention,” she says. Grab a pack of these to engage and entertain your babe on a nice day. They’re small enough to fit in your diaper bag, stroller caddy or even your pocket for on the go, too.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: Plastic</li><li>Batteries required: No</li><li>Age range: 4-15 (caregivers will need to blow bubbles for baby)</li><li>Price at time of publish: From $5.40</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Portable</li><li>Super engaging</li><li>Provides sensory stimulation</li><li>Increases attention</li><li>All kids love them</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Leaves a residue so can be tough to clean up, so they’re best used outdoors</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>These touchable bubbles are a blast for babies, keeping them busy and providing lots of sensory stimulation. <strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Touchable Mini Bubbles Wand Toy</a></p><h3><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Copper Pearl Oceana Squirtie Bath Toy Set</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Copper Pearl Oceana Squirtie Bath Toy Set</h3></p><p>Bathtime is the ultimate sensory experience for babies.

They are supremely soft, made for cuddling, and the perfect first stuffy for little ones. As Mintz points out, “beginning to understand social cues and forming attachments is important. Dolls, stuffed animals, and toys that encourage imitation play can be helpful.” This is one of my personal go-to baby shower gifts for new parents. It’s lightweight enough for littles to hold and carry, and a toy that can be enjoyed, snuggled, and played with long past the baby stage.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: ‎Polyester, plastic pellets/eyes</li><li>Batteries required: No</li><li>Age range: 0+</li><li>Price at time of publish: $28</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Super soft</li><li>Lightweight</li><li>High quality</li><li>Provides comfort and security</li><li>Encourages imitation play</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>It’s spot clean only</li></ul><h3><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Mobi Peeka Developmental Mirror</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Mobi Peeka Developmental Mirror</h3></p><p>Mirror, mirror on the wall, who’s the cutest baby of them all? This portable and collapsible mirror is packed with so many benefits for babies. “Looking together in the mirror helps your baby learn to imitate facial expressions, which then helps them learn to imitate sounds and eventually words,” says Mintz. “It's a great way to connect and bond with your baby.” This shatterproof mirror also doubles as a fun sensory toy, with textured beads, balls, and handles for baby to explore.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: ‎Food-grade silicone</li><li>Batteries required: No</li><li>Age range: 0+</li><li>Price at time of publish: $24.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>BPA- and phthalate-free</li><li>Doubles as a sensory toy</li><li>Lots of developmental and language benefits</li><li>Collapses for on the go</li><li>Shatterproof</li><li>Easy to clean</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>While pricey, this popular sensory mirror offers a slew of developmental benefits, encouraging babies to crawl and imitate facial expressions and sounds.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Mobi Peeka Developmental Mirror</a></p><h3><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Colored Organics Kendi Star Stacker</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Colored Organics Kendi Star Stacker</h3></p><p>“This is wonderful for babies, as it’s a toy and teether all in one,” says Bowen-Poole. Each piece is made of BPA-free, non-toxic silicone that’s super grippy and small enough for small hands to easily pick up, grasp, and play with. When your baby isn’t putting each piece into their mouth to teeth on, they’ll love exercising their hand-eye coordination and learning colors as they stack.

I have a one-year old myself, and I’ve tried tons of toys over the past seven years. I included personal faves of my own and my children, as well as favorites of the experts I interviewed. I also looked at product reviews and only included toys with excellent ratings.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-choosing-a-toy-for-a-6-12-month-old>What to consider when choosing a toy for a 6-12-month old</h2><p>“Playing with the right toys can help a child's development between six and 12 months by improving their motor skills, stimulating their senses, enhancing problem-solving abilities, boosting language development, and supporting emotional and social growth,” says <a rel=nofollow href=#>Mintz</a>. When selecting toys to engage and entertain your little one, here are some important things to keep in mind.</p><h3>Safety</h3><p>Sue Warfield, president of <a rel=nofollow href=#>ASTRA</a> and certified play expert, advises parents to steer clear of toys with small, loose parts, “as all things go into the mouth at this age.” Mintz echoes this concern. “Avoid toys with small parts that can be choking hazards, toys with sharp edges, and those made from toxic materials. We want sturdy toys that won't break into little pieces,” she says.</p><h3>Age appropriateness</h3><p>“Checking age grade on the package is important,” says Warfield. In this case, you want to look for toys recommended for children ages six to 12 months. These toys are safe for your baby to play with, and developmentally appropriate, as well.</p><h3>Sensory stimulation</h3><p>Karri Bowen-Poole, founder of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Smart Playrooms</a>, suggests looking for toys that engage the senses, such as touch, sight, and sound. Sensory toys, such as balls in a variety of sizes, shapes, colors, and textures are a popular one for this age group.</p><h3>Motor skill, cognitive, and language development</h3><p>Many six- to12-month-olds are already on the move! To improve motor skills, “look for toys that encourage reaching, grasping, crawling, and moving, like soft balls, mats, and push or walking toys,” recommends Bowen-Poole. Toys “that promote cause and effect, problem solving, and spatial awareness,” are great for cognitive development, while toys that talk or encourage conversations or labeling can help develop language skills, she adds.</p><h3>Their Interests</h3><p>No two babies are alike: What one child prefers, another couldn’t care less about. “Allow babies to take the lead in play and follow their interests and cues,” says Bowen-Poole. “Observe their preferences, reactions, and behaviors to understand what types of play activities engage and stimulate them the most.” And if you’re looking to deepen your connection with your baby, Mintz says, “finding toys that encourage parent interaction such as books, rolling balls, and bubbles help foster early attachments.”</p><p>Below, you’ll find our selections, and remember, if you find this guide useful, you may also be interested in our guides to the best toys for 0-6 months, the best toddler toys, and the best shower gifts.</p><p>The information presented here is created by TIME Stamped and overseen by TIME editorial staff.
