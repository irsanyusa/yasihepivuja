The SNP leader had been <a href=#>facing a vote of no confidence</a> in the Scottish Parliament after his coalition agreement with the Scottish Greens fell through.</p><p data-block-key=efeid>Now a new YouGov survey, with fieldwork conducted immediately prior to Yousaf’s resignation, shows how Scotland felt about the political landscape and the prospect of the SNP continuing in power.</p><h3 data-block-key=2vxkl>Latest voting intention</h3><p data-block-key=4hvq5>YouGov polling at the beginning of the month <a href=#>showed</a> that the SNP had fallen to their lowest Westminster vote share since the independence referendum in 2014, and were also now behind Labour for the first time since that date.</p><p data-block-key=2ocqg>Our new poll shows that Labour continue to hold on to their very slender lead in Westminster voting intention north of the border. A third of Scottish voters (34%) say they intend to back Labour (+1 from our poll in late March / early April), while 33% say they will back the SNP (+2). The Conservatives trail in a distant third place on 14% (no change).</p><p data-block-key=ca4f7>When it comes to voting intention for the Scottish Parliament, the SNP are holding on to their narrow lead in the constituency vote – 36% (+2) versus Labour’s 32% (no change) – and are likewise slightly ahead in the regional vote at 31% (+2) to Labour’s 28% (-1).</p><h3 data-block-key=eme3l id=how-well-had-scots-thought-humza-yousaf-was-doing-as-first-minister-before-he-resigned>How well had Scots thought Humza Yousaf was doing as first minister before he resigned?</h3><p data-block-key=69nkr>Humza Yousaf <a href=#>began his premiership as an unpopular figure</a>, and this remained the case throughout his time in office. In YouGov polling earlier this month, 55% of Scots said he was doing a good job as first minister, compared to 27% who thought he was doing a bad job.</p><p data-block-key=97a7f>In our new poll the proportion of Scots saying that Yousaf has been doing a bad job has risen sharply to 67%, with only 20% saying his performance has been positive. This gives him a net job approval rating of -47.</p><p data-block-key=cbpv5>By contrast, Anas Sarwar, the leader of the Scottish Labour Party, has a positive approval rating overall (+4). Around one in three Scots (36%) think Sarwar is doing a good job, compared to 32% who disagree.</p><p data-block-key=48d4>Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross remains unpopular, with only 22% saying he is doing well and 49% saying he is doing badly.</p><p data-block-key=7ce2s>Having now left power, the Scottish Greens’ co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater are even less popular now than they were the last time we asked a year ago. In April 2023, 40% had thought the two Green co-leaders were doing badly; this figure has since risen to 46%, while the proportion who think they are doing well is largely unchanged (17%, from 20% a year ago).</p><h3 data-block-key=q4b5e id=was-it-right-for-the-coalition-agreement-between-the-snp-and-greens-to-end>Was it right for the coalition agreement between the SNP and Greens to end?</h3><p data-block-key=6sr6u>Relations between the governing SNP and Green parties had <a href=#>been increasingly tense in recent months</a>, with Humza Yousaf having told Scottish voters in March that backing the Greens at the general election was a wasted vote, and with the Greens frustrated by a lack of progress on key policies.</p><p data-block-key=2q25h>The Scottish public tend to think that the two parties were right to end their alliance, although this only accounts for 37% of Scots saying so. One in four (27%) disagree, while 36% are unsure.</p><p data-block-key=8lcj6>Among those who backed the SNP at the 2019 general election, there is a slight tendency to think the separation was the wrong call, by 39% to 33%.</p><h3 data-block-key=akrtv id=how-should-the-no-confidence-vote-have-gone>How should the no-confidence vote have gone?</h3><p data-block-key=5kk17>The no-confidence vote that Yousaf was facing stood on a knife’s edge. Had he not resigned, <a href=#>he would have been reliant on the vote of the Alba party’s MSP Ash Regan</a> – who had defected from the SNP last year in protest of its loss of focus on independence – in order to hold on to his job.</p><p data-block-key=89hnp>Yousaf’s departure is clearly not unpopular among the Scottish public – in the event that the no-confidence vote had happened, 55% of Scots would have wanted to see the Scottish Parliament vote to remove the first minister. This includes fully 40% of those who voted for the SNP in 2019 – about the same number as wanted Yousaf to cling on (41%).</p><p data-block-key=780kn>Overall, only 24% of Scots had hoped to see Yousaf survive the no-confidence vote.</p><p data-block-key=p3nd><i>Please note that this question was asked before it became clear that two no-confidence votes were being called – one on Yousaf himself (the loss of which would not have required him to resign) and one on the Scottish government (which would).</i></p><h3 data-block-key=o0sqi id=was-it-right-to-scrap-the-carbon-emissions-target>Was it right to scrap the carbon emissions target?</h3><p data-block-key=6gl5q>Part of the reason for the collapse in the SNP-Green coalition was the SNP’s decision to <a href=#>abandon Scotland’s target to cut carbon emissions by 2030</a>.</p><p data-block-key=251fo>Scots are split over the move – 40% think it was the right call, while 37% think it was the wrong move. Those who backed the SNP in 2019 are likewise split, with 38% in support but 41% opposed.</p><h3 data-block-key=zawgy id=independence-tracker>Independence tracker</h3><p data-block-key=b11bi>The latest results for our Scottish independence voting intention tracker put the No side on 54% (+1 from early April) and the Yes side on 46% (-1).</p><p data-block-key=35n18><a href=#><b>See the full results here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=34b4h>What do you think of Humza Yousaf, Scottish politics and independence, and everything else?
