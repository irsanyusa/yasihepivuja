Some companies also use Spirit Week to reflect on the past year, set goals for the coming year and share <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/guides/1498868-planning-tips-learn-how-day/ href=#>planning tips</a> to get the most out of the year.</p><h3>Spirit Week ideas for work</h3><p class=align-left>To get the most out of Spirit Week, the activities have to be fun, inclusive of all staff and encourage group participation.

It could be a fun way to boost staff morale.</li><li><strong>Cartoon characters day</strong>: Cartoons were a Saturday morning staple for a lot of people’s childhoods.
