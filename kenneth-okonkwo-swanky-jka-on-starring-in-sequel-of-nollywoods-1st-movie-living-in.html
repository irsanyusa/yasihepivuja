The test of a good actor is that you can do well in all roles that you are signed up to play. But if you are conversant with the first Living In Bondage then you will know that it ended where I was converted. So I was already converted in the first one so it's just a continuation of that. And you know I hold my faith very seriously, thank God. When I did the first Living In Bondage I wasn't this spiritual but now I have become quite spiritual, so it was quite sweet to handle being a man of God in the sequel," he said.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-674c9eee-a088-40d3-9794-0d8e6b8da394 data-caption="Kenneth reminded us that the script for the first Living In Bondage was shot in vernacular which is usually harder to shoot.

But over a while, we started thinking about it. As a matter of fact, the actors of the movie were already gathering together to do something like that before one great guy, Charles Okpaleke from nowhere just got the inspiration. You know businessmen act more swiftly and immediately he worked on it, started calling people together. When he met me, I think that was the first time he brokered the idea to me at an artistic exhibition at the American embassy. He told me about it and I told him that 'Its just God that revealed this to you." he said.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-239b7d43-d90c-4e99-a9af-f44e40c1424b data-caption="Obviously a young man in his 20s, I was curious enough to ask Swanky JKA how old he was when the first Living In Bondage was released and you'd be shocked at his response.
