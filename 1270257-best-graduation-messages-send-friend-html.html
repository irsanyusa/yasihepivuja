Finding the right words can be an uphill task. It is, however, not impossible. One thing you could do is to try and keep the message as personal as possible. Write about how the graduate's efforts have finally paid off.</p><h2>Congratulations graduation messages</h2><p class=align-left>Just writing, "Congratulations graduate," may not be enough. This shows a lack of creativity and thoughtfulness. After all, anyone can scribble that down. Your message is likely to be appreciated more if you take a while to craft it.</p><ul><li>Hey there, I hope you are prepared for the world with its big offers. All the best.</li><li>Congrats dear, you deserve every great thing coming your way.</li><li>I am so proud of you. I just hope this is the first of many times I get to brag about knowing you.</li><li>You deserve a hug for a job well done. May this graduation message forever remind you of your achievements.</li><li>You will hear a lot on this day but mine is simple and straightforward, I am glad and happy you made it. Congratulations!</li><li>With a heart filled with so much joy and happiness for you, I wish you all the best as you take the next step in life.</li><li>Many came, many saw but only a few conquered. For these reasons, you are among the brightest people I know. Thank you for setting a good record.</li><li>The journey was tough and many are times giving up seemed like the viable option. I am proud of you for having held on to the end. You deserve the crown of excellence.

Fortunately, there is a way to make the card work other than the simple happy graduation message it comes with. Keep it casual and funny with a touch of something personal that only the two of you can relate to.</p><ul><li>We both know that you are going to be the star of our crew.
