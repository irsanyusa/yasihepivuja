A small, countrified looking woman got on and took the seat in front of her. The conductor, taking tickets, stopped at her seat but she looked straight ahead. “Your ticket, madam,” he said. She replied, “I have no ticket.” He asked, “Your pass, then?” She looked him in the eyes as she held up the stump of an arm and answered, “This is my pass.” The conductor took another look and kept on going. It was Jesse James’s mother. It was the same conductor and the train that had brought the Pinkertons who dynamited the James house and blew Mrs. James’s hand off.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">CAROLINE LOCKHART L Slash Heart Ranch Dryhead, Mont.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Only Decent Manner</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sirs:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In TIME, March 6 there appeared an article dealing with the refusal of the Daughters of the American Revolution to permit the Negress Anderson to sing in Constitution Hall in Washington. In this article, Washington was referred to as “provincial.” This was spiteful and entirely unjustified. Remarks of that nature show that all small people do not live in small towns. . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You mention a “mass” meeting of 1,500 (probably all Northerners) who protested the D.

As for Child Labor, the N. C. W. C. favors its limitation by act of Congress. Most U. S. Catholic bishops are against the Child Labor Amendment, whose language they believe would permit Congress to invade the home and the school.—ED.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Why?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sirs:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Why don’t you ever say anything positive about Hitler?

Menke is centuries out of the way when he claims (TIME, Feb. 27, p. 28) that “the U.

He was so disliked by the natives that he was nicknamed ‘Johnny Crapaud’ (French for toad). The pastime became known as ‘Crapaud’s Game,’ then ‘Crap’s Game,’ finally . . . craps.” . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Crabs is a word of antiquity. In 1761 Lord Carlisle is quoted: “If you . . . will play, the best thing I can wish you is, that you may win and never throw crabs.” In 1801, when young Marigny was sowing his wild oats in London Town, The Sporting Magazine printed: “Dreamt that I had thrown crabs all night and couldn’t nick a seven.” . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Creoles, especially Creole Negroes (who loved the game) could not easily pronounce the term “crabs”—when they did yell it, it sounded like “craps.” . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Such is the true ancestry of L’il Joe, Big Dick, and Ada from Decatur.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">STANLEY C.
