Her first husband was Jimmy Gulzar, the Dutch dancer, whom she married in 1998. They had a daughter before divorcing in 2000. Their relationship took a dark turn as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jimmy attacked</a> his wife's sister Danielle and got prosecuted for it. Brown <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">won custody</a> over their child and had to pay alimony settlement to her ex-husband.</p><p class=align-left>One of her most famous relationships was with the actor Eddie Murphy, whom she began dating in 2006. Eddie became the father of her second child. Mel B and Eddie Murphy love story was brief as they separated in 2007.

They lived together for ten years before another Mel B divorce took place in 2017. As Brown left her husband, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filed a restraining order</a> against him and made public accusations of physical and emotional abuse. Belafonte, in return, accused her of "wiping out" all of her Spice Girls money due to her luxurious lifestyle.</p><h3>Mel B nanny scandal</h3><p class=align-left>The ex-nanny of the star, Lorraine Gilles, got caught up in her divorce from Stephen Belafonte and shared some things about their private relationship. Mel B nanny confessed that the star spoke untrue things about her in her divorce statement and portrayed her as a homewrecker and a backstabber.</p><p class=align-left>Lorraine mentioned that she had a long-lasting sexual relationship with Melanie and sometimes engaged in group sex with her and her husband. She also said that there was a misconception that she got pregnant with Stephen's baby when in reality, it was with some random man that she had a one-night stand with, and Brown paid for her abortion.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/24f635254a5b125a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The chronicle of the life and career of Keri Russell</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The former nanny said that she wishes her ex-employer and lover treated her with respect like she did over the past seven years. She even mentioned that Melanie's children wrote her thank-you cards.</p><p class=align-left>It was reported that the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">true reason</a> behind Mel and Lorraine's conflict was the nanny knowing more about her relationship with her estranged husband than anyone else, meaning that she could use the information in court. Lorraine was also thought to own private videos of their encounters, even though she refuted this claim.</p><p class=align-left>Since then, the case has been settled, as the Scary Spice reportedly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">agreed to pay</a> Lorraine £1.8million.</p><h3>Mel B children</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9277a6feaa10d015.jpg><p class=align-left>The celebrity has three daughters from three different men.
