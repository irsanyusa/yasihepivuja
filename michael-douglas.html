The closer a&nbsp;show is&nbsp;to&nbsp;real life and existing people, the closer viewers will feel to&nbsp;it. That’s why people get the most attached to&nbsp;sitcoms and comedy movies, since their themes are closer to&nbsp;regular life. In&nbsp;that manner, it&nbsp;shouldn’t come as&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprise that people crave to&nbsp;see their favorite shows back on&nbsp;the air or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least their stars reunited even for a&nbsp;short period of&nbsp;time.</p><a class=eb077af78f10923627b2 title="9 Celebrity Couples Who Don’t Care About Their Age Gap (Spoiler: Sylvester Stallone Is a Really Lucky Guy)" data-test-id=article-card-link href=#><h3 class="a2cad1d7e851b457f648 b09977b947ef04108b40 bc315c92b3f6942e64b7" data-test-id=article-card-title>9 Celebrity Couples Who Don’t Care About Their Age Gap (Spoiler: Sylvester Stallone Is a Really Lucky Guy)</h3></a><a class=b3eba81ad98ad333369f title="9 Celebrity Couples Who Don’t Care About Their Age Gap (Spoiler: Sylvester Stallone Is a Really Lucky Guy)" data-test-id=article-card-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/336x177/jpg/8db/6ef/02c05259a69ff1ddaccc94b51c.jpg></a><p class=e174b611e61cd43b60b8 data-test-id=article-card-description>American scientists think that the perfect age gap between a&nbsp;wife and a&nbsp;husband is&nbsp;one year. In&nbsp;this case, spouses have a&nbsp;much smaller chance of&nbsp;separation at&nbsp;just 3%. If&nbsp;the difference is&nbsp;more than 5&nbsp;years, they’re 18% more likely to&nbsp;split&nbsp;up, and if&nbsp;the gap is&nbsp;more than 20&nbsp;years, the divorce risk is&nbsp;95%.
