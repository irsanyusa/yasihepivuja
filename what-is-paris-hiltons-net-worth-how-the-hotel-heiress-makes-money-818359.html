Over the past few years, she has undergone an&nbsp;incredible transformation from a&nbsp;party girl to&nbsp;the mother of&nbsp;two children. Recently Hilton has shared her journey of&nbsp;welcoming children through surrogacy and the actions she took to&nbsp;make the upcoming motherhood experience “feel real” to&nbsp;her.</p><p><h2>She wore a&nbsp;prosthetic baby bump while expecting via surrogate.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a4d/c6b/2e9de85e468062623cfaf8dfd2.jpg><p>The media star and her husband, Carter Reum, had two children through surrogates. They <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> the birth of their son, Phoenix Barron Hilton Reum, in January 2023 and their daughter, London Marilyn Hilton Reum, in November 2023.</p><p>"I wanted to know what it felt like to be pregnant, so I bought a prosthetic stomach and wore it around the house for the day," Hilton <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>.</p><p>"I know that sounds crazy, but I wanted it to feel real — even in just this small way," she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continued</a>. "Feeling that weight on the front of me, running my hands over it, envisioning a whole life in front of us." Hilton wrote that by the end of the day, she realized wearing the fake bump was a "silly" idea since she would soon be holding her newborn.</p><p>"It didn't matter that no one else could see that I was expecting," the former reality star <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>. "My emotional baby bump was real, it was precious, and I was so completely happy to know it was exactly where it needed to be, growing warmer and bigger every day."</p><p><h2>Hilton also shared that she had always dreamed of&nbsp;having twins.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/490/105/c400005bee811642a690d416db.jpg><p>Hilton revealed that although it might have seemed like a "mistake" for her and her husband to welcome their son and daughter in the same year, it was actually their plan.</p><p>Hilton <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a>, "The dream was to have a girl and a boy, born separately but at the same time, so they'd grow up as twins." She described it as "a real-life miracle" that both of their "angel surrogates" became pregnant within the same year. However, she also shared that it doubled her worry and fear.</p><p>"I was afraid to breathe. It was like watching over two little baby birds in a nest — so fragile, so precious, and completely out of our hands," she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p><h2>There wasn’t a&nbsp;huge fortune waiting for her to&nbsp;inherit.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f60/1eb/80ad875c3eab77b8cda3d90cbd.jpg><p>Paris may be&nbsp;an&nbsp;heiress, but there wasn’t a&nbsp;huge fortune waiting for her to&nbsp;inherit. <strong>Her <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>’s wealth is&nbsp;massive, </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>estimated</strong></a><strong> at&nbsp;about $4.5&nbsp;billion.</strong> But her grandfather, Barron Hilton, decided back in&nbsp;2004 to&nbsp;give away 97&nbsp;percent of&nbsp;his money to&nbsp;charity.</p><p>When Barron passed away in&nbsp;2019, <strong>he&nbsp;left just&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>3% of&nbsp;his wealth </strong></a><strong>to&nbsp;his 8&nbsp;children, 15&nbsp;grandchildren, and 4&nbsp;great-grandchildren</strong>. This amounted to&nbsp;around <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>$135 million</a> in&nbsp;total. While not a&nbsp;small amount, considering the family, Paris’s share would have been about <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>$5.6 million</a> if&nbsp;divided evenly. The majority of&nbsp;the money went to&nbsp;the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, as&nbsp;per Barron’s wishes.</p><p>There were even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rumors</a> suggesting that Paris might have been excluded from her grandfather’s will completely. It’s said that he&nbsp;wasn’t happy with her numerous scandals and felt she brought shame to&nbsp;the Hilton name.</p><p>Nevertheless, things seemed to&nbsp;have turned out the way Paris wanted. She once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “Ever since&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;teenager, I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;independent. I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;ask my&nbsp;family for anything.”</p><p>Despite her family background in&nbsp;the hotel business, Paris built her own successful empire. She even mentioned her grandfather, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>telling</a> her, “I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;known as&nbsp;Barron Hilton. Now I’m known as&nbsp;Paris Hilton’s grandfather.”</p><p><h2>Childhood and teenage trauma</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/36c/ce4/a56ccc5391934a9361abb17d2a.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Born</a> on&nbsp;February&nbsp;17, 1981, in&nbsp;New York City, Paris Hilton was born into wealth as&nbsp;the great-granddaughter of&nbsp;Conrad Hilton, the founder of&nbsp;Hilton Hotels. Her lineage automatically placed her in&nbsp;a&nbsp;position of&nbsp;privilege and affluence.</p><p>When Paris Hilton was young, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lived</a> in&nbsp;different places like Beverly Hills, the Hamptons, and even in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fancy hotel in&nbsp;Manhattan. Her family says <strong>she was quite a&nbsp;tomboy who dreamed of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;veterinarian</strong>. She saved up&nbsp;money to&nbsp;buy unusual pets like monkeys and snakes. Once, she even accidentally let a&nbsp;snake loose in&nbsp;the hotel she was staying&nbsp;at.</p><p><strong>Her </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>upbringing</strong></a><strong> was pretty strict</strong>. Her parents didn’t let her date, wear makeup, or&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;school dances. They even made her take etiquette classes to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;debutante, although she didn’t feel comfortable with&nbsp;it.</p><p>But when she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>moved</a> to&nbsp;New York City, Paris started rebelling. She skipped classes and went to&nbsp;parties instead. Her parents got worried and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sent</a> her to&nbsp;boarding schools for troubled teens, when she was 16. One of&nbsp;these schools, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Provo Canyon School</a>, is&nbsp;where she says <strong>she was mentally and physically mistreated by&nbsp;the staff</strong>. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;documentary called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>This Is&nbsp;Paris</i></a>, she and others who went to&nbsp;the same school talk about things they suffered in&nbsp;this school. After about 11&nbsp;months, she was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>released</a>, around the time she turned&nbsp;18.</p><p><h2>Modeling career in&nbsp;the late 1990s</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5c8/884/eec22d5391bf6a5e889c1edd3a.jpg><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, Paris <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started</a> modeling at&nbsp;charity events. In&nbsp;2000, she signed with agency T&nbsp;Management. She strutted down the catwalk for various designers during New York Fashion Week, laying the groundwork for a&nbsp;decent modeling career.</p><p>Paris later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>modeled</a> for well-known brands like Guess and Christian Dior. She occasionally <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>returns</a> to&nbsp;her runway roots, such as&nbsp;when she modeled for Yeezy&nbsp;6 Collection in&nbsp;2018. These early modeling opportunities probably played a&nbsp;significant role in&nbsp;boosting her bank balance.</p><p><h2>Rise to&nbsp;fame</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b5/b51/f2477e5b4aaa571a2c8d1c26a3.jpg><p>Paris Hilton’s rise to&nbsp;fame accelerated in&nbsp;the early 2000s, when she became a&nbsp;fixture in&nbsp;the New York City social scene. Her appearances in&nbsp;tabloids and reality shows like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Simple Life</i></a>, which she starred in&nbsp;alongside Nicole Richie, catapulted her into mainstream stardom. In&nbsp;2005, reports surfaced that Paris earned <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>$5&nbsp;million for just one season</strong></a><strong> </strong>of&nbsp;the show.</p><p>Hilton’s unique blend of&nbsp;charisma, glamour, and controversy made her a&nbsp;media sensation, garnering her a&nbsp;massive following and endorsement deals.</p><p>«I&nbsp;knew&nbsp;I wasn’t trying to&nbsp;build an&nbsp;ordinary career. I&nbsp;was building a&nbsp;brand that would eventually turn into multiple income streams. But that sounds way more calculated than it&nbsp;was,» Hilton <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talks</a> about her early days when she would get paid to&nbsp;attend parties and draw the attention of&nbsp;the paparazzi.</p><p><h2>First book and fragrance line</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ce/9f0/f2e8d45932957fbeccf2c96c61.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Confessions of&nbsp;an&nbsp;Heiress: A&nbsp;Tongue-in-Cheek Peek Behind the Pose</i></a> hit the shelves in&nbsp;2004 and quickly became a&nbsp;bestseller. Just a&nbsp;year later, Paris released her second book, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Your Heiress Diary: Confess It&nbsp;All To&nbsp;Me</i></a>. With her books still in&nbsp;circulation after around 15&nbsp;years, it’s safe to&nbsp;say Paris has earned quite a&nbsp;bit from her short stint as&nbsp;an&nbsp;author.</p><p>A&nbsp;big chunk of&nbsp;Paris Hilton’s net worth comes from her fragrance business, which is&nbsp;quite impressive. She’s launched over <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>24&nbsp;perfumes</a> to&nbsp;date. Since 2004, <strong>her perfumes have raked in&nbsp;an&nbsp;astounding </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>$3&nbsp;billion</strong></a> in&nbsp;revenue. Paris <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ranks</a> as&nbsp;the seventh most popular celebrity fragrance brand.</p><p>Paris expressed her pride in&nbsp;her fragrance line, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, «I&nbsp;couldn’t just have one! The fans want more, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;meet their demands. I&nbsp;might have 100 one day.»</p><p><h2>Music and acting career</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec7/60c/ad44455870a060eedbeda15856.jpg><p>After starting her own record label, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Heiress Records</a>, Paris released her first album, «<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Paris</a>,» in&nbsp;2006. The album sold 200,000 copies and reached No.&nbsp;6&nbsp;on the Billboard 200&nbsp;chart. Her single, «Stars Are Blind,» climbed to&nbsp;No.&nbsp;18&nbsp;on the Hot 100&nbsp;chart, as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reported</a> by&nbsp;Billboard.</p><p>Since then, Paris has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>released</a> nine other promotional singles but hasn’t come out with another full album yet. While it’s not clear exactly how much Paris has earned from her <a href=# title=music data-link=tag>music</a> career, the sales of&nbsp;her album likely brought in&nbsp;a&nbsp;substantial amount of&nbsp;money.</p><p>Besides her music ventures, Paris also found success as&nbsp;a&nbsp;DJ. In&nbsp;2012, she made her&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>DJ debut</a> at&nbsp;a&nbsp;music festival in&nbsp;Brazil. She<strong> received </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>awards</strong></a><strong> for her performances</strong>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>landed</a> a&nbsp;residency at&nbsp;Harrah’s in&nbsp;Atlantic City in&nbsp;2014, and even <strong>went on&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>a&nbsp;13-show tour</strong></a><strong> </strong>in&nbsp;Spain, France, Portugal, South Korea, Colombia and New Jersey. By&nbsp;2015, Paris had <strong>become the</strong> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>highest-paid DJ&nbsp;in&nbsp;the world</strong></a>, reportedly earning over <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>$1&nbsp;million per set</strong></a>.<strong></strong></p><p>She once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, «I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;bragging, but it’s great to&nbsp;be&nbsp;paid well for what you <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> doing. My&nbsp;mother always told me&nbsp;it’s not polite to&nbsp;discuss money, but it’s true. I’m very proud. I’ve worked hard.»</p><p>Throughout the years, Paris has ventured into acting, appearing in&nbsp;both <a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a> and&nbsp;TV shows. After her reality&nbsp;TV days, Paris transitioned into scripted roles on&nbsp;the big screen. She starred in&nbsp;movies like <i>House of&nbsp;Wax</i> and made appearances in&nbsp;films like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Zoolander</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Cat in&nbsp;the Hat</i></a>. However, information about her earnings from acting is&nbsp;scarce. On&nbsp;television, Paris made guest appearances in&nbsp;episodes of&nbsp;popular shows such as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Supernatural</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The O.C.</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Veronica Mars</i></a>.</p><p><h2>Paris also makes money for appearances.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8da/51d/dfa6fb5a249e2ca9ed09d9a77a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2012, she<strong> </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>received</strong></a><strong> $1&nbsp;million for her appearance</strong> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Kim Jang Hoon music video.</p><p>Even before her&nbsp;DJ gigs, Paris was getting paid to&nbsp;attend events. «It&nbsp;started when&nbsp;I was 16&nbsp;and first moved to&nbsp;New York City, and&nbsp;I just started getting offers to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;different events,» she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>. «Then, all of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden it&nbsp;was like, ’We’re going to&nbsp;pay you a&nbsp;million dollars to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;Japan’ and my&nbsp;sister and&nbsp;I started going around to&nbsp;different events and parties.<br>And then from there, George Maloof called&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;said, ’Paris, I’m opening the new Palms Hotel in&nbsp;Las Vegas, and&nbsp;I would love to&nbsp;fly you down in&nbsp;a&nbsp;jet, and&nbsp;I want you to&nbsp;wear this million-dollar dress. It&nbsp;has a&nbsp;million dollars’ worth of&nbsp;the Palms’ chips on&nbsp;it, and&nbsp;I will pay you to&nbsp;come.’»</p><p><h2>Real estate investments and deals with brands</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/569/01d/782f225daaab47ce273f53edb9.jpg><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;her entrepreneurial pursuits, Paris Hilton has invested in&nbsp;real estate properties worldwide. From lavish mansions to&nbsp;luxury apartments and hotels, her real estate portfolio reflects her penchant for opulence and extravagance. Hilton’s savvy investments in&nbsp;prime properties have not only served as&nbsp;lucrative assets but also as&nbsp;symbols of&nbsp;her affluent lifestyle.</p><p>Paris <strong>earns approximately </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>$10 million</strong></a><strong> per year</strong> from her 19&nbsp;product lines. Her name is&nbsp;associated with various products, including supplements, and even flowers. Additionally, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>owns</a> 50&nbsp;retail stores worldwide.</p><p>Paris has also been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>featured</a> in&nbsp;numerous commercials, such as&nbsp;her well-known ads for Carl’s Jr.&nbsp;in&nbsp;2014. In&nbsp;her latest commercial, she was seen sitting on&nbsp;an&nbsp;inflatable couch in&nbsp;a&nbsp;swamp alongside Steve Irwin’s children for an&nbsp;Uber Eats&nbsp;ad, which likely paid handsomely.</p><p>However, Paris is&nbsp;selective about the brands she partners with. Her manager <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reveals</a> that she rejects between 12&nbsp;and 20&nbsp;brand partnerships daily. Nonetheless, the deals she does accept contribute significantly to&nbsp;her income.</p><p><h2>Cooking show</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af2/710/16ffee54488335fa05f14c54d5.jpg><p>Paris took on&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;executive producer for her show, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Cooking With Paris</i></a>, inspired by&nbsp;a&nbsp;YouTube video of&nbsp;her cooking that garnered 5&nbsp;million views. Featuring celebrity guests like Kim Kardashian and Nikki Glaser, the show quickly became a&nbsp;hit on&nbsp;the streaming platform. «It’s definitely not your average cooking show. I’m not a&nbsp;professional or&nbsp;trained chef, so&nbsp;I’m learning a&nbsp;lot in&nbsp;the kitchen as&nbsp;I&nbsp;go,» Paris <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>.</p><p>However, certain aspects of&nbsp;<i>Cooking With Paris</i> came with hefty expenses, possibly contributing to&nbsp;its lack of&nbsp;renewal for a&nbsp;second season. Viewers might have noticed Paris sporting stylish outfits and skipping the apron, leading to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reported</a> $2,000 dry-cleaning bill. While the exact earnings from her shoe deal remain undisclosed.</p><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;her cooking venture, Paris and her husband were the stars of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Paris in&nbsp;Love</i></a>, a&nbsp;wedding show that premiered in&nbsp;November 2021. The series followed Paris and Carter Reum as&nbsp;they planned their wedding. «He’s like no&nbsp;one I’ve ever met in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life before, the first person that I’ve let into my&nbsp;heart that&nbsp;I trust completely. He’s my&nbsp;biggest supporter and just lifts me&nbsp;up&nbsp;and makes me&nbsp;feel so&nbsp;safe,» Paris <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a>.</p><p>She also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentioned</a> shifting her focus from money to&nbsp;starting a&nbsp;family, «Now, I’m more focused on&nbsp;babies than billions.»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ab/ba2/df8ca45657a9c5d105db9a1306.jpg><p>Paris Hilton is&nbsp;enjoying the simple life with her two children, Phoenix and London.</p><p>In&nbsp;November 2021, the heiress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> entrepreneur Carter Reum in&nbsp;a&nbsp;private ceremony in&nbsp;Los Angeles. Their first child together, son Phoenix, was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a> via surrogate on&nbsp;January&nbsp;16, 2023.

I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;I knew what love was with my&nbsp;husband, but as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;I met my&nbsp;baby, it’s just this love on&nbsp;another level.
