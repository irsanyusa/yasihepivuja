Finally, I worked to include desks available at different price points, so our list includes options that can work with multiple budgets.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-choosing-a-gaming-desk>What to consider when choosing a gaming desk</h2><h3>Materials</h3><p>Neha Jain, a gamer, digital entrepreneur, and founder of the puzzle game <a rel=nofollow href=#>ShootBubbles</a>, encourages buyers to pay attention to the materials used in a desk’s construction. “Desks crafted from high-quality and durable woods like oak, walnut, maple, and cherry often indicate superior craftsmanship,” she says. Consider the material’s durability, too: Glass gaming desks may be eye-catching, but can be easily scratched. Bamboo is a durable material that also offers an attractive, smooth finish.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>Gaming desks come in several shapes, including regular rectangular designs and an L-shaped desk, which makes a 90-degree angle. Straight desks are typically best for rooms with limited space, while L-shaped desks will take up a corner of a room.</p><p>Standing desks are also becoming popular as gaming desks. These desks allow you to adjust their height to use while standing or sitting, and have grown popular since, according to <a rel=nofollow href=#>Yale Medicine</a>, sitting for long hours can lead to lower back pain and spine issues.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>Caleb McGennis, an eSports coach and cofounder of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Toxic Tournaments</a>, explains that it’s important to choose a gaming desk size that works well for your specific needs. “The best size for a gaming desk depends on how many monitors you have on your desk, but 40 to 80 inches is a good range to shoot for,” he says.</p><p>It’s also important to consider the desk’s height. According to <a rel=nofollow href=#>Control Physical Therapy</a>, a desk should allow you to sit comfortably in an ergonomic position, and the surface of the desk should be at the same height as your elbows, whether you’re sitting or standing. You should also be able to look straight ahead at your monitors rather than looking up or down. You’ll also need to consider your height and the height of your gaming chair when choosing the best gaming desk height.</p><h3>Features</h3><p>Consider the features that matter most to you in a gaming desk. Jain recommends choosing a desk with drawers, a good cable management system, and a <a rel=alternate href=#>gaming headset</a> holder, which can help to keep the space organized. Additionally, a curved front edge allows you to sit slightly closer to the desk and can maximize your comfort.</p><h3>Max load capacity</h3><p>The desk’s max load capacity, or the maximum amount of weight that it can support, needs to exceed the weight of your gaming setup. When calculating your setup’s weight, be sure to factor in the weight of monitors, speakers, headphones, and anything else that will be on your desk. The ideal max load capacity will depend on your gaming setup, but it’s always a good idea to buy a table that well exceeds that weight, so you can expand and add onto your system in the future without worrying about weight.</p><h3>Assembly</h3><p>As you shop for a gaming desk, look for information about the assembly process. Being able to review a digital copy of the assembly instructions is ideal, though user reviews can give you a sense of how easy the assembly is. Think about the amount of time involved, whether any special tools are required, and if the desk includes all of the required hardware for assembly.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>Gaming desks can range significantly in price. As you determine your budget for the desk, remember that the desk is just one part of the equation, and it’s also important to budget money for a quality <a rel=alternate href=#>gaming chair</a>.</p><h3>Aesthetic</h3><p>Finally, consider the desk’s overall aesthetic. This is largely a matter of personal preference, but finding a desk that reflects your style and the colors of your gaming setup can help to complete your gaming room.</p><h2 id=how-to-set-up-a-gaming-desk>How to set up a gaming desk</h2><p>First, focus on keeping the space clean and well-organized. Find a desk that gives you the space you need for your whole setup, and consider choosing a wide and deep desk, which can give you plenty of space and contribute to a clean aesthetic.</p><p>Opting for all <a rel=alternate href=#>wireless gaming headsets</a>, mice, keyboards, and other accessories can result in complicated charging, so focus on cable management options to conceal and organize wires. Consider running your wired hardware through the central support pillar of your monitor for a cleaner gaming desk. Investing in the <a rel=alternate href=#>best monitors</a> you can afford will also enhance your gaming experience.</p><p>Don’t forget about the space under your desk, too. Keep the space clean so you have plenty of room to move around and stretch out while you’re gaming.</p><p>While it’s important to buy a gaming desk that’s at the right height, pairing the desk with quality gaming chairs is essential. There are some good <a rel=alternate href=#>budget gaming chairs</a> out there, but <a rel=alternate href=#>ergonomic office chairs</a> can also work until you decide what you really want in a gaming chair. Kicking back in some <a rel=alternate href=#>bean bag chairs</a> might seem like a comfortable option for a while, but investing in a quality gaming chair will give you the support and positioning that you need for comfortable, longer gaming sessions.</p><h2 id=types-of-gaming-desks>Types of gaming desks</h2><p>Most gaming desks are either straight or corner desks, but plenty of variation exists within those types. Adding monitor platforms, different storage options, and various accessories means that desks of the same type can have very different appearances.</p><h3>Straight desks</h3><p>Straight desks are available in many sizes, from the compact to the extra-long. These desks usually have supports on either end, but the middle portion of the desk typically remains open, providing space for the gamer’s legs.</p><h3>Corner desks</h3><p>Corner desks can be ideal if you have space available in the corner of a room. These L-shaped desks can also be curved.</p><h3>Standing gaming desks</h3><p>Standing gaming desks give gamers the option of sitting or raising the desk to accommodate a standing height. Some of these desks feature a manual adjustment, while others are motorized.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is the best size for a gaming desk?</h3><p>“The best size for a gaming desk is 60 inches wide by 30 inches deep,” says Jain. That desk size offers enough room for monitors, a keyboard, mouse, and speakers.</p><h3>Which company makes the best customized desktop for gaming?</h3><p>Jain recommends the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Eureka Ergonomic L60 Gaming Desk</a>, noting that its build quality is excellent and that the desk features a built-in cable management system, as well as a tray for surge protection.</p><h3>What is the right height for your desk when gaming?</h3><p>“To find your ideal desk height for gaming, sit comfortably with your feet flat on the ground, relax your shoulders, and angle your elbows at about 90 degrees,” advises Jain. “Your desk should be just below this elbow height. You can achieve this height by simple adjustments, including keyboard trays, raising your chair, or putting a footrest below your desk.”</p><h3>What shape of desk is best for gaming?</h3><p>There is no one shape of desk that’s better for gaming. Your preferences will determine the type of desk that you most enjoy, but Jain notes that if you’re working with limited space, an L-shaped desk can help maximize that space.</p><h3>Are corner desks better for gaming?</h3><p>McGennis explains that corner desks provide more space in a smaller area while also making it easy to reach your gaming system. “L-shaped desks also offer the ability to have separate spaces,” says Jain. Ultimately, whether a corner desk is better depends on your room setup and your preferences.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1ll5a6qrrGZpueq5uofA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gwen-stefani-may-have-influenced-blake-shelton-to-get-botox.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gwen Stefani May Have Influenced Blake Shelton To Get Botox">&larr;
