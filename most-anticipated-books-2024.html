The historical fiction epic centers on Frances “Frankie” McGrath, a 20-year-old nursing student who enlists in the Army Nursing Corps in 1965 right before her older brother Finley is killed overseas.

The four formerly deceased characters are forced to compete in a series of high-stakes magical challenges. The winners get to stay alive—and the losers will be sent back to the realm of the dead.

Like her 2017 debut Goodbye, Vitamin, Real Americans is set on the West Coast, this time on a small island off the coast of Washington state. It’s 2021, and Lily Chen is a single mom raising a 15-year-old boy who decides to search for his birth father. But the journey is complex—and uncovering answers about the boy’s father only leads to more questions. By following three generations of the family, Khong explores the forces that shape a person's sense of self and probes the connection between identity and fate.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Real Americans on <a href=#>Bookshop</a> | <a href=#>Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Funny Story, Emily Henry (April 23)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/anticipatedbooks-25.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A rising<strong>-</strong>star writer of literary romance, <a href=#>Emily Henry</a> has garnered a devout readership by consistently delivering dreamy modern love stories. Building on a run of best-sellers—from Beach Read (2020) to Happy Place (2023)—in which Henry found innovative ways to subvert tropes of the genre, Funny Story puts the author’s signature spin on the idea that opposites attract. The novel centers on Daphne, a down-on-her-luck librarian whose fiancé Peter recently dumped her for his childhood best friend Petra. Finding herself at a crossroads, Daphne decides to move in with Petra’s ex-boyfriend Miles. Hijinks, heartache, and a healthy dose of temptation ensue.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now: </strong>Funny Story on <a href=#>Bookshop</a> | <a href=#>Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The Demon of Unrest, Erik Larson (April 30)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/anticipatedbooks-22.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Best-selling author <a href=#>Erik Larson</a> has spent his writing career meticulously reconstructing critical junctures in history, from the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair in The Devil in the White City to the rise of the Third Reich in In the Garden of Beasts to the sinking of the Lusitania in Dead Wake. Larson’s nonfiction accounts of these fateful events feel like novels, making his books as readable as they are informative. In The Demon of Unrest, Larson digs into the months between Abraham Lincoln’s election as the 16th president of the United States and Confederate forces firing the first shots of the Civil War at Fort Sumter. As Larson told the <a href=#>Associated Press</a>, he was particularly interested in exploring “the human element—the hubris, the personalities, the ambitions, the egos”—that led to America’s fracturing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now: </strong>The Demon of Unrest on <a href=#>Bookshop</a> | <a href=#>Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>This Strange Eventful History, Claire Messud (May 14)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/anticipatedbooks-16.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Inspired by acclaimed author Claire Messud’s own ancestry, This Strange Eventful History chronicles seven decades in the lives of a fictional family of Algerian-born French citizens.
