From producers to singers and rappers, the list of Starboy alumni continues to grow, with more additions and exits.</p><p><strong>Maleek Berry</strong></p><p>The Nigerian producer who is based in the UK worked extensively with Wizkid in 2013, scoring the hit track ‘The Matter’, and proceeded to do more work. He was signed to Starboy Entertainment the following year, but nothing was said about his exit.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Legendury Beatz</strong></p><p>The production duo of Mutay and Zei were part of the earliest members of the Starboy movement. Although they still work with Wizkid, they are currently under no contractual agreement with the singer. While working with Wizkid, they have provided multiple hit records.</p><p>LAX was first signed to Wizkid in 2013, and by the end of the year, he had scored ‘Caro’, a hit record. The next year, Wizkid and the singer also released ‘Ginger’, which became another hit. In 2016, the singer announced his exit, and has gone on to an independent career.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>R2bees (Mugeez, Omar Sterling)</strong></p><p>In May 2016, Wizkid announced the signing of some Ghanaian musicians, as he launched his Starboy Worldwide label. R2bees were a core part of that signing as one of the artists snatched up by the label. Subsequent information proved that it was an ad hoc partnership to cover when they all collectively record together.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Mr Eazi was a part of the Starboy Worldwide announcement. But it was an arrangement that hasn’t provided any new record. The affiliation though has benefited Mr Eazi, with many Nigerian music enthusiasts confused as to the nature of the deal.</p><p>The Ghanaian songstress was a part of the Starboy Worldwide push, and her skills were deployed effectively on ‘Daddy yo’ and ‘Sexy’, two records off Wizzy’s “Sounds From The Other Side.”</p><p><strong>Willybang (Silly)</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Wizkid and Silly, who later switched his name to Willybang, were upcoming hustlers and friends during their early days. Willybang would later become affiliated to Starboy, but ended his pursuit of music, to become the Head of Branding.</p><p>Ahmed, a 12-year-old rapper was signed rather publicly by Wizkid, after thrilling the crowd with a freestyle at the Starboy concert in December 2017. Although there are photos of him hanging with Wizkid, he is yet to drop a record, neither has much been revealed about Starboy’s plans for him.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Terri, a singer, tagged Wizkid to a video in December 2017. Wizkid reached out and further conversations held, which concluded with a signing to Starboy Music. Terri made his first appearance as a Starboy act on ‘Soco’, a new record by Wizkid.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mrKyhk2TEqsbKoptmoJWnsrR5xK%2Bcq7FdosK0tcKimKdlpJ2utXnHmq2eZZWrsrN5wZ6cp2WjnrSvscNmmbJlo6mus67Osmagm52du3ax</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./julien-denormandie-attenue-la-portee-de-lobjectif-des-40000-ventes-de-logements-hlm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Julien Denormandie attnue la porte de l'objectif des 40.000 ventes de logements HLM">&larr;
