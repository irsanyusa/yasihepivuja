She wants her sister to&nbsp;honor the agreement they made when her sister agreed to&nbsp;babysit Rebecca’s children but later changes her mind.</p><p><h2>The two sisters made a&nbsp;specific agreement that they were expected to&nbsp;uphold.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/58d/9c3/b81e1d547ca208e5bd905e4657.jpg><p>Speaky English? I never learned gibberish.</p><p>Rebecca, a&nbsp;30-year-old, recently shared a&nbsp;family issue involving her 20-year-old sister, Anna, who is&nbsp;currently a&nbsp;university student. Rebecca expressed her frustration, saying, “I&nbsp;allowed my&nbsp;sister Anna to&nbsp;stay with&nbsp;us while she attended university. In&nbsp;exchange, we&nbsp;agreed she’d contribute $500 each month. This covers her living expenses, utilities, and food, which&nbsp;I think is&nbsp;quite reasonable. Additionally, she helps out with household chores and our two kids. We&nbsp;even documented our agreement to&nbsp;avoid any misunderstandings.”</p><p>Rebecca elaborated, stating, “Based on&nbsp;my&nbsp;understanding, shared accommodation at&nbsp;Anna’s school costs around $1,200&nbsp;monthly, only available during the 8&nbsp;months of&nbsp;school. So, staying with&nbsp;us costs her $6,000&nbsp;a year, compared to&nbsp;$9,600 for 8&nbsp;months at&nbsp;school and 4&nbsp;months with our mom and stepdad. This arrangement worked smoothly for two years. She’s a&nbsp;diligent student and a&nbsp;wonderful person.”</p><p><h2>There has been a&nbsp;noticeable strain in&nbsp;the relationship between the sisters.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ee/801/7bd3ec501a97053850b0997d29.jpg><p>Rebecca continued her story, expressing, “Recently, Anna and&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;major disagreement where&nbsp;I feel she’s completely in&nbsp;the wrong. Unfortunately, our parents are siding with her, which is&nbsp;frustrating. The issue arose because Anna now has a&nbsp;serious boyfriend, and naturally, she wants to&nbsp;spend more time with him, which I&nbsp;understand. However, she’s also started to&nbsp;complain about babysitting the kids every other Saturday night so&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I can have a&nbsp;date night. This caused a&nbsp;significant rift between&nbsp;us.”</p><p>Rebecca clarified, stating, “Since we&nbsp;have our agreement and Anna’s still in&nbsp;university, I&nbsp;insisted she stick to&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;even offered to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;babysitter myself, but&nbsp;I made it&nbsp;clear she’d have to&nbsp;cover the cost since she was originally supposed to&nbsp;watch the kids. Now Anna’s upset with&nbsp;me, claiming that paying the babysitter is&nbsp;eating into all her earnings.”</p><p><h2>Rebecca is&nbsp;facing criticism from all her family members at&nbsp;the moment.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d3f/6e6/14f44e5c79997e55f6630982cd.jpg><p>I dont see anywhere in this story that Rebecca is having her children raised by Anna. She said that her sister helps out with them and watches them two Saturday nights each month so they can get some them time away from the kids. That is also something that a caring sister does for her sibling. She has also given her a comfortable place to stay at a greatly reduced cost and she doesnt have to worry about moving out every eight months. The parents of Anna and Rebecca also may have ulterior motives themselves. They would and should be helping Anna pay for the cost of her rental situation. Where are they in all of this? Do they "babysit" too? The cost of living has got way out of hand anymore and as much as we all would love to help even family the reality is we all need to pitch in. Rebecca is not running a free bnb. Also a good Aunt would love to help. Why is it all up to Rebecca to offer free place to stay? Anna thought the agreement was good for two years but now its just asking too much? Just because the parents are on Anna"s side doesnt make her right.</p><p>Rebecca shared, “Anna got really upset with me&nbsp;after&nbsp;I made my&nbsp;suggestion. She felt like&nbsp;I was taking advantage of&nbsp;her. She was furious and declared that she’d rather stay on&nbsp;her university campus next year. I&nbsp;calmly told her that it&nbsp;sounded like a&nbsp;great idea and assured her it&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;an&nbsp;issue for&nbsp;me. Plus, I&nbsp;mentioned how I’d regain my&nbsp;hobby room once she moved out.”</p><p>Rebecca expressed her frustration, saying, “I&nbsp;faced criticism from all sides of&nbsp;my&nbsp;family. My&nbsp;parents phoned me&nbsp;and insisted that Anna shouldn’t be&nbsp;treated like an&nbsp;unpaid nanny. They stressed the importance of&nbsp;sibling support without any financial expectations. My&nbsp;mom even went as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;demanding that Anna live in&nbsp;our house rent-free, claiming&nbsp;I shouldn’t interfere with her finances. Despite explaining our agreement, they remained adamant.”</p><p>She continued, “When I&nbsp;mentioned Anna’s plan to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;campus next semester, my&nbsp;mom became furious, threatening to&nbsp;sever ties with&nbsp;me. When I&nbsp;returned home, I&nbsp;found Anna packing without a&nbsp;word about where she’d stay. She accused me&nbsp;of&nbsp;being unfair, arguing that increased expenses and time away from her job and boyfriend were harsh. I’m torn because&nbsp;I believe our agreement was reasonable.”</p><p><h2>We’d like to&nbsp;offer you some guidance.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/08e/6db/a767a154a399938bb399d5438a.jpg><p>Our suggestion is&nbsp;to&nbsp;seek a&nbsp;compromise that benefits both you and Anna. <strong>Instead of&nbsp;making Anna pay the entire babysitting fee, consider splitting it&nbsp;evenly between you both</strong>. Alternatively, you could discuss creating a&nbsp;schedule where you take turns watching the kids, ensuring that both of&nbsp;you have time for your personal lives without burdening the other.</p><p>We&nbsp;believe that having a&nbsp;calm conversation with Anna and <strong>finding a&nbsp;solution that works for both of&nbsp;you is&nbsp;achievable</strong>. We&nbsp;hope that you can resolve this issue without causing further strain on&nbsp;your family relationships.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/afe/14b/10fe435ddebda43b0ec997c05f.jpg><p>Completely Ridiculous "Agreement" aside, your 20yr sister is a College Student that is paying her sister $500 a mo & doing her share in chores, studying & attempting to have a social life if possible? You have her as your in house babysitter, I can understand a Once in a while helping out with the children if she chooses too but making her take on the responsibility for your offspring is taking advantage of your younger sister when she's probably already stretched thin. Having Responsibilities is fine but as her sister, shame on you for taking advantage of her.</p><p>It’s important to&nbsp;offer Anna a&nbsp;sincere apology for any distress your disagreement may have caused her. Exploring alternative solutions together is&nbsp;key. Remember, <strong>you’re family, and supporting each other is&nbsp;crucial</strong>, even during tough times. Money and childcare can be&nbsp;tricky topics, leading to&nbsp;misunderstandings, but it’s essential to&nbsp;address them openly.</p><p>Regarding your family’s involvement, it’s vital to&nbsp;<strong>communicate that you intend to&nbsp;reconcile with Anna and establish clear boundaries</strong>. Don’t allow others to&nbsp;pressure you into actions you’re not comfortable with. Your decisions should be&nbsp;based on&nbsp;what’s best for you and Anna, not on&nbsp;external influences.</p><p>It’s tough when someone we&nbsp;trust and care about deeply ends up&nbsp;hurting&nbsp;us deeply. Recently, a&nbsp;woman opened up&nbsp;about her painful experience when her <a href=#><strong>best friend of&nbsp;20&nbsp;years broke her trust</strong></a> and caused embarrassment for her and her husband.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6edKiqq2domK%2FprLUrJysZaSkeqOtwbKqoqxdosZut8idqmaclai9qsDEZqauql2eu6rAyJqjZpmXp7KmucSnq2aZnpl6sMHRZp2apZmhxm610mamp2WYmr9uv8idnGZwYW2GdoOO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brit-marling-zal-batmanglij-sister-develop-film-tv-projects-1236042525.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The OA Creators Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij to Develop Film and TV Projects at Siste">&larr;
