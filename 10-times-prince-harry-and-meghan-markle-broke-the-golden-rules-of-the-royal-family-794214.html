Until recently, the main rebel of&nbsp;the British royal family was Princess Diana, and she had good reasons for&nbsp;it. For example, her revenge dress, her honest interviews about her relationship with her husband, or&nbsp;her hugs with people who had HIV. Every single one of&nbsp;these acts shocked the media and other members of&nbsp;the Royal family.</p><p>But today, the biggest rebels among the monarchs are the Duke and the Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex that continue to&nbsp;prove the idea that most Royal rules and traditions are things of&nbsp;the past.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;recall some of&nbsp;the cases when <a href=# title="Prince Harry" data-link=tag>Prince Harry</a> and <a href=# title="Meghan Markle" data-link=tag>Meghan Markle</a> decided to&nbsp;ignore royal etiquette and it&nbsp;seems that they don’t regret&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>1. Meghan Markle doesn’t wear a&nbsp;bra during an&nbsp;official event.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/db4/144/8ce92a5dd1b69201c31c859605.jpg><p>For her first appearance in&nbsp;public as&nbsp;the Duchess, Meghan Markle chose a&nbsp;nude dress from Goat and a&nbsp;hat from Philip Treacy that matched the dress. It&nbsp;all seemed okay until the press and internet users noticed that she didn’t wear a&nbsp;bra. The unwritten rules say that the women of&nbsp;the royal family can’t appear at&nbsp;official events without wearing this piece of&nbsp;underwear. But the Duchess has her own opinion about&nbsp;it. Because Markle supports the idea of&nbsp;<a href=#>feminism</a>, she is&nbsp;convinced that an&nbsp;elegant style can and should be&nbsp;combined with her own personal comfort.</p><p><h2>2. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle don’t hide their feelings in&nbsp;public.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/53a/a86/5e24d25ef4a5038876b686569d.jpg><p>Hugs and, of&nbsp;course, kisses in&nbsp;public are frowned upon in&nbsp;the Royal family, but the Duke and Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex don’t think that there is&nbsp;anything wrong with&nbsp;it. They regularly hold hands and hug each other, and after the win in&nbsp;the charity polo event, Prince Harry kissed Meghan Markle passionately. However, these gestures during sporting events are not a&nbsp;rare thing. Princess Diana also kissed Prince Charles after these matches.</p><p><h2>3. Meghan Markle closes car doors by&nbsp;herself.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b42/79e/f424195ec2920a5358a1893cad.jpg><p>Even though this thing is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;big violation of&nbsp;the protocol, the members of&nbsp;the Royal family don’t do&nbsp;that. Etiquette expert William Hanson <a href=#>pointed out</a> that this is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;protocol breach and said, “Usually, if&nbsp;you are a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the royal family or&nbsp;a&nbsp;dignitary, you have a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;staff to&nbsp;open and close a&nbsp;car door for you.” But her old habits show how shy Markle still&nbsp;is.</p><p><h2>4. Prince Harry flew to&nbsp;Canada to&nbsp;see Meghan Markle after his Caribbean tour.</h2></p><p>Even before Prince Harry proposed to&nbsp;Markle, he&nbsp;visited her in&nbsp;Toronto where the actress was in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;shooting a&nbsp;film. But this actually contradicts the official policy of&nbsp;the royal family that states that its members <a href=#>should not </a>combine official visits with their personal affairs. After his Caribbean tour, Prince Harry was supposed to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;London where he&nbsp;had some public events planned, but he&nbsp;went to&nbsp;see Meghan instead.</p><p><h2>5. Meghan Markle doesn’t wear pantyhose.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd9/b90/24e4805479afba3e9564c8f9af.jpg><p><a href=#>Pantyhose</a> are a&nbsp;must-have element in&nbsp;the wardrobe of&nbsp;the Royal family members when they appear in&nbsp;public. Queen Elizabeth II&nbsp;requires the Royal family to&nbsp;always follow this rule no&nbsp;matter what the weather&nbsp;is. But Meghan Markle has appeared in&nbsp;public several time not only ignoring this rule, but also wearing open toed shoes, which are another taboo, according to&nbsp;royal etiquette.</p><p><h2>6. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle took their shoes off on&nbsp;the beach.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/278/dab/f3cb8c5966b5c34dc920445fcd.jpg><p>During a&nbsp;visit to&nbsp;Australia in&nbsp;October 2018, the Duke and the Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex visited the famous Sydney Bondi Beach. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle took off their shoes and walked on&nbsp;the beautiful sand barefoot, which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;direct <a href=#>contradiction</a> of&nbsp;royal etiquette. This prohibition works mostly for women. And Kate Middleton, unlike the Duke and the Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex follows this rule. During her visit to&nbsp;Australia in&nbsp;2014, the wife of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Prince William" data-link=tag>Prince William</a> walked on&nbsp;the beach wearing her shoes.</p><p><h2>7. Meghan Markle didn’t wear a&nbsp;name tag with her name during a&nbsp;horse race.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f72/87d/33f2ef5cb489ae62cb02665cd2.jpg><p>The annual Royal race in&nbsp;Ascot has very strict <a href=# title="dress code" data-link=tag>dress code</a> <a href=#>requirements</a>. The female visitors of&nbsp;this prestigious event have to&nbsp;choose dresses with closed shoulders that are at&nbsp;least of&nbsp;knee-length. They are also supposed to&nbsp;wear elegant hats and special branded name tags with their names. But during the 2018&nbsp;race, Meghan Markle ignored the requirement for her name tag. Unlike other guests, the Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex didn’t put a&nbsp;badge on&nbsp;her dress, but kept it&nbsp;in&nbsp;her hand instead. By&nbsp;the way, the only member of&nbsp;the Royal family that doesn’t have to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;name tag is&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II.</p><p><h2>8. Meghan Markle walks in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;Prince Harry</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/92e/1bb/cc9d0e5f098839b88b44ef1144.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;the royal protocol, the members of&nbsp;the Royal family whose origin or&nbsp;status is&nbsp;lower are supposed to&nbsp;stay behind. Meghan Markle has been ahead of&nbsp;Prince Harry many time during public events.</p><p><h2>9. The Duke and the Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex congratulated Prince George in&nbsp;an&nbsp;unorthodox way.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8a0/022/8358a15c1888e6fe9425ab0586.jpg><p>The words of&nbsp;Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;too <a href=#>informal</a> to&nbsp;many people. They didn’t just leave a&nbsp;comment under George’s photo that was published on&nbsp;the official Instagram page of&nbsp;Kensington Palace (and they were supposed to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;separate post on&nbsp;their own Instagram page), but they also forgot to&nbsp;mention the full title of&nbsp;the future king. Even in&nbsp;this informal congratulation message, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were supposed to&nbsp;call him His Royal Highness.</p><p><h2>10. Meghan Markle regularly wears black outfits in&nbsp;public.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bc1/40d/6d880259e6a79fb1a3d0e14959.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the Royal family, black colors are only used during mourning events. More than that, every time a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the royal family travels somewhere, they pack a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;black clothes in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;return home wearing these clothes, in&nbsp;case the monarch dies. This unwritten tradition has been followed since 1952 when Elizabeth II&nbsp;was visiting Kenya and her father died. The Princess didn’t have black clothes with her and she wouldn’t leave the plane until a&nbsp;mourning dress was <a href=#>delivered</a> to&nbsp;her.</p><p>Meghan Markle regularly wears black clothes at&nbsp;official events. She even visited the 2018 British Fashion Awards with black nail polish, which is&nbsp;another violation of&nbsp;the royal etiquette that <a href=#>allows</a> women to&nbsp;have nude or&nbsp;pink nails only.</p><p>Meghan Markle, the Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex, is&nbsp;known for her <a href=#>rule-breaking fashion choices</a>. From off-the-shoulder dresses to&nbsp;ripped jeans, she has consistently pushed the boundaries of&nbsp;royal fashion. Her style choices, including wearing pantsuits and opting for a&nbsp;messy bun, have been seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;breath of&nbsp;fresh air in&nbsp;the often rigid world of&nbsp;royal fashion.</p><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;her fashion-forward approach, Meghan has also used her clothing to&nbsp;<a href=#>send powerful messages</a>. For instance, in&nbsp;2018, she carried an&nbsp;acrylic clutch with a&nbsp;constellation of&nbsp;Leo, her zodiac sign, embellished on&nbsp;it. This subtle detail was a&nbsp;personal touch that added a&nbsp;unique element to&nbsp;her outfit.</p><p>Meghan’s fashion hacks are also <a href=#>worth noting</a>. For instance, she often wears shoes that are one to&nbsp;two sizes larger than her actual size to&nbsp;prevent blisters and discomfort. She also uses a&nbsp;toothbrush and hairspray to&nbsp;tame flyaway hairs, a&nbsp;simple yet effective trick for maintaining a&nbsp;polished look. These practical tips, coupled with her bold fashion choices, make Meghan a&nbsp;true style icon.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think that when this couple breaks the royal rules, they show disrespect toward other monarchs? Or&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;just an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;be&nbsp;closer to&nbsp;ordinary people and a&nbsp;good tendency in&nbsp;general?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xedOipJ6rXaW%2FqrrCnmShmaKnxm6tzZ1kpp2Xna6vecyaqaSklWKvs7vKnmStoJVitLC4w56lZqqlobK0ec6fZK2glWK%2FsMXApWSfmZ2eubp5lnJra2lkZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ben-jerry-ice-cream-40.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's Founding Story: How They Changed Ice Cream">&larr;
