However, it&nbsp;wasn’t for vanity but a&nbsp;deeply personal and heartbreaking reason. Discover the truth behind her choice.</p><p><h2>Christina Applegate: A&nbsp;career defined by&nbsp;resilience</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce7/d65/5752e35023afc638605a0c2410.jpg><p>PHOTOlink/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News<span>, </span>PHOTOlink/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News</p><p>Christina Applegate’s <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> spanning over 30 years is a testament to her incredible resilience and talent. From her early days as Kelly Bundy on <i>Married… with Children </i>which aired from 1987 to 1997 to her acclaimed role in <i>Dead to Me</i>, <a href=#>Applegate</a> has consistently demonstrated her talent and determination. She won a Primetime Emmy Award for her guest appearance on <i>Friends</i> and earned <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nominations</a> for her roles in <i>Samantha Who?</i> and <i>Dead to Me</i>. Her performance in <i>Dead to Me</i> was particularly praised, earning her multiple Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe nomination.</p><p>Applegate’s film career is equally impressive. She has appeared in a variety of movies, including <i>Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</i>, <i>The Sweetest Thing</i>, and <i>Bad Moms</i>. Her versatility as an actress is evident in her ability to seamlessly transition between comedic and dramatic roles. In recognition of her contributions to the entertainment industry, she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2022</a>.</p><p>Despite facing significant health <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>challenges</a>, including a breast cancer diagnosis in 2008 and a multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis in 2021, she has continued to shine in the entertainment industry. Applegate’s journey with MS has been particularly challenging. She has openly shared how the disease affects her daily life, making even simple tasks <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>difficult</a>. Yet, she remains a symbol of strength and perseverance, continuing to work and inspire others despite her condition.</p><p>Her ability to navigate these personal battles while maintaining a successful career highlights her dedication. Christina Applegate’s story is not just one of talent, but of unwavering strength in the face of adversity.</p><p><h2>The Hollywood pressure: Why plastic surgery is so common.</h2></p><p>In Hollywood, the pressure to maintain a youthful and flawless appearance is immense. This <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pressure</a> often leads many Hollywood actresses to opt for plastic surgery. The entertainment industry is highly competitive, and actors and actresses frequently feel the need to look their best to secure roles and stay relevant. Ageism and the constant scrutiny of their looks can make them feel that cosmetic enhancements are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>necessary</a> to compete with younger stars.</p><p>The media and public expectations play a significant role. Celebrities are constantly in the spotlight, and any signs of aging or imperfections are often highlighted and criticized. This relentless focus on appearance can drive them to seek surgical solutions to maintain their image.</p><p>The availability of advanced cosmetic procedures and skilled surgeons in places like Los Angeles makes it easier for celebrities to undergo these transformations. The combination of industry demands, public scrutiny, and accessible cosmetic treatments contributes to the prevalence of plastic surgery in Hollywood.</p><p><h2>Christina’s decision at&nbsp;27: The heartbreaking truth</h2></p><p>At the age of 27, <a href=#>Christina Applegate</a> faced a deeply personal and challenging decision that led her to undergo her only plastic <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>surgery</a>. While working on a television show, a producer commented on the bags under her eyes, suggesting they were too prominent and causing issues with the lighting. This remark struck a nerve with Christina, as the bags were a hereditary trait she had inherited from her family.</p><p>Feeling pressured by the industry’s harsh standards and the need to conform to a certain image, Christina decided to have the bags surgically removed. This decision was not made lightly; it was driven by a mix of professional pressure and personal insecurity. The experience was emotionally taxing, leaving a lasting impact on her self-esteem and <a href=# title="body image" data-link=tag>body image</a>.</p><p>Christina has since spoken openly about this experience, highlighting the intense scrutiny and unrealistic expectations placed on actors, especially Hollywood actresses. She has expressed regret over the surgery, emphasizing that it was a decision made out of a sense of shame and pressure rather than personal desire. This moment in her life serves as a poignant reminder of the often unseen emotional toll that the entertainment industry can take on individuals.</p><p><h2>How Christina Applegate has embraced her authentic self.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bf3/ed8/db613c50238a8cb8eee777bb7f.jpg><p>In recent years, Christina Applegate has found a renewed sense of <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>authenticity</a>, especially after her multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis in 2021. This life-changing event has led her to embrace her true self and speak openly about her experiences. Christina has shared that living with MS has freed her from the pressures of conforming to industry standards and expectations. She no longer feels the need to filter herself or adhere to the demands of her employers.</p><p>She has become an outspoken advocate for those living with MS, using her platform to raise awareness and support others facing similar challenges. Her honesty about her condition and its impact on her daily life has resonated with many, offering a sense of solidarity and understanding.</p><p>By embracing her authentic self, Christina has also highlighted the importance of self-acceptance and the power of vulnerability. She encourages others to be open about their struggles, emphasizing that it is okay to not always feel okay. Her message is one of compassion and resilience, reminding us all that we are seen and loved, no matter what we are going through.</p><p><h2>Celebrities who’ve opened up&nbsp;about plastic surgery</h2></p><p>Several celebrities have openly discussed their experiences with plastic surgery, helping to reduce the stigma around cosmetic procedures. One notable example is <strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong>, who revealed on the <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</i> reunion special that she had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>undergone</a> a nose job. She mentioned that no one had directly asked her about it before, and she also shared that she has had some injections, though not Botox, as she had a bad reaction to it.</p><p>Another celebrity who has been candid about her plastic surgery is <strong>Dolly Parton</strong>. The country music legend has never shied away from admitting to her various procedures. She famously said, “If something is bagging, sagging, or dragging, I’ll tuck it, suck it, or pluck it.” Parton has had multiple surgeries over the years to maintain her appearance, including breast augmentations and facelifts.</p><p><strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong> has also talked about her plastic surgery. The model revealed that she had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>liposuction</a> on her armpits, removing 2 inches of fat. She admitted it was a silly decision, but had no regrets.</p><p>Teigen has also been candid about her breast augmentation and subsequent removal of the implants. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> that she initially got the implants for her swimsuit modeling career to make her chest look perkier. However, she later decided to have them removed, saying she wanted to feel more comfortable and fit into her clothes better.</p><p>Some other famous personalities who have openly talked about getting cosmetic procedures done are Cardi B, Kourtney Kardashian, Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Aniston, Amanda Bynes, Wendy Williams, Courteney Cox, Mickey Rourke, Jane Fonda, Bella Hadid, and Jamie Lee Curtis.</p><p>Christina Applegate’s husband has been her rock throughout her difficult journey.
